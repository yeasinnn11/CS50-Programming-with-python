<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Yeasin Arafat</h1>
<h2 align="center">An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learned how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. Learned about functions, arguments, and return values; variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learned how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Explored hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Complete exercises inspired by real-world programming problems.</h2>
